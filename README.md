# MagicSpeed
Source code for the **frontend** of [speedtest.magiclike.net](https://speedtest.magiclike.net),

You can find the backend on the branch `MagicSpeed-backend`.

This is a modified version of LibreSpeed, tailored to my needs. To support the original developer or contribute to software base, visit the upstream repo at [librespeed/speedtest](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest).
